# Crop-Production-Prediction-with-EDA-using-Linear-Regression

This project is a Linear Regression project which is used to predict the production of crops in India based on the different features
Also i have Exploratory Data Analysis to analyse how diff features effect the production of the crops.

# The input features are:-
1. State name - Name of the state
2. District name - District name of the state
3. Crop year - The year in which the crop was cultivated
4. Season - Different crop seasons of India
5. Area - Area of land in hectares

# The output label:-
* Production - Crop production in tonnes

Though I have used Linear Regression, in the end the model was not able to predict values, instead had alot of error, where i have explained and demonstrated how Linear Regression was not a proper choice of algorithm for predicting the production of the crops, using different error metrics and residual plots.
